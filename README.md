1. Have a look at frogs.html. (You will want to re-type this in fish.html.)

4. Add three images with img tags from pexels.com to your document
5. Add three links with a tags to external websites (like: https://bing.com)
6. Get creative! You now know a lot of HTML tags and attributes. Try them out or search out new ones!
7. Check to make sure your HTML tags open and close. Check to make sure your HTML tags are in the BODY of the file, not in the HEAD. Check to make sure you have indented nested tags.
